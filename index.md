### Excursion Project (Codecedemy)

In this project, I created a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” I've used your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so I've used video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
